Sir, we’ve never entered a plane before.”
That was the voice of Hauwa & Nafisa — quiet, excited, a bit nervous.
It hit me then: this was bigger than just a tech competition.

It started with a share…
When we saw the post shared by a colleague. A call for applications for the National-Girls in ICT Competition, I knew it was the kind of opportunity we couldn’t ignore.

We quickly put together a team:
— Hauwa Ejura Muhammad (Team Lead)
— Nafisa Hamzah Aliyu
— Hafsa Cisse

Brilliant girls. Eager to learn. Willing to try.

We poured energy into our application, not sure what to expect. Then came the first win:
We were shortlisted.

From over 200 applicants nationwide, our team was selected as one of the 37 schools to compete at the regional level. We were part of the North Central region — ready to represent our school, our state (Plateau), and every young girl who dares to dream in a male-dominated space.

The Regionals: Confidence Tested
The competition was tough.
Every team brought their best ideas and brightest girls.
But we didn’t shrink.
We showed up, pitched well, and pushed through our nerves.

We ended up as runners-up — just behind Niger State, and by a very slim margin. The judges remarked:

“You girls impressed us. Their clarity, their confidence — it’s rare at this level. You’re nearly the winner for us, Team Solace!”

That meant only one thing:
We were going to the Nationals.

The Nationals: 13 States, One Dream
The final stage brought together just 13 teams — the best from every region across Nigeria, including:
Ogun, Anambra, Edo, Taraba, Kaduna… and Plateau — our girls.

For Hauwa, Nafisa, and Hafsa, it was more than just tech.
It was their first time on a plane.
We flew from Bauchi to Abuja, sponsored by the Federal Government, who covered everything — flights, meals, accommodation, logistics.

In Abuja, the girls explored places they had only read about:
— The ICT Museum
— National Data Centers
— Foreign Embassies
— And networking sessions with top women in tech and government.

For three full days, they learned, presented, competed, and grew.

What This Journey Taught Me
As a tech educator and founder of Algorise Tech Explorers, I’ve always believed in building grassroots tech talent. But this journey reminded me:

— Exposure changes everything.
— Girls need visible wins to believe they belong in tech.
— Nigeria is full of untapped talent just waiting to be supported.

The pride in my students’ eyes when they returned — not as “just girls learning tech” but as national finalists — is something I’ll never forget.

Final Thoughts
We didn’t win the top spot.
But we won something far greater: belief.
In themselves. In their abilities. In the future they can shape with code and courage.

From Arabic classrooms to AI workshops, from Scratch projects to cloud bootcamps, this journey has never been just about tech for me. It’s about creating pathways.

And to every young girl out there:
You’re not too small.
You’re not too late.
You’re not alone.

Let’s keep building.
